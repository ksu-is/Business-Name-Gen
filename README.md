# Business-Name-Gen
This software will be in the form of a generator for entrepenuers looking for names for their business. When starting a company, it can be very difficult and time consuming when trying to think of a name for your business. This program will allow companies to put in any key words that they feel should be in the name and from that, generate a full company name that will be to the liking of the owner.

# How Program Will Operate
With our software being based off a passowrd generator, the user will be able to input their last name as well as a key word that describes their business, that they would like to be included in their company name. From that point, the generator will then run and generate a business name that includes the key words that were previously inputted. If the name is not to the owner's satisfaction, they are able to restart the system and allow the program to generate another name. Once they are satisfied with a generated name, the business owner will then type "yes" and the system will combine the created word with the key words that were previously inputted to create the complete business name.
